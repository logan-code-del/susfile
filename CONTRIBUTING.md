Thanks for helping improve this project — below are quick contribution guidelines and the commercial-permission workflow.

How to report issues and request features
- Use the issue templates: click "New issue" → choose one of:
  - Bug report
  - Feature / suggestion
  - Discussion / forum

Commercial distribution / permission requests
- If you want to commercially distribute, monetize, or include the Software in a paid product you MUST get written permission first.
- To request permission, open the "Commercial distribution / permission request" issue template at `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/commercial-permission.md`. That template collects the information maintainers need to evaluate requests (org, product, revenue model, proposed revenue share, timeline, etc.).
- The maintainers will review the issue and may ask follow-ups on the issue thread. If permission is granted, the terms (or a notice that permission was granted) will be posted to the issue thread and a written agreement will be provided. The repository maintainers may move sensitive details to private channels as appropriate.

Reporting bugs
- Use the Bug report template and include steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, environment info, and logs/screenshots when possible.

Suggesting features
- Use the Feature / suggestion template to propose improvements. Include user stories, benefits, and any mockups.

Community discussions
- For design discussion and general questions use the Discussion / forum template. If GitHub Discussions is enabled you may prefer that feature for longer threads.

Legal / licensing
- This repository is licensed under CNARS v1.0. The license file is `LICENSE.md`. Commercial use is prohibited without explicit written permission. The default revenue-share in the license is set to 20% of net revenue; see `LICENSE.md` for details.

Thank you — contributions and respectful discussion are welcome. If you want me to add a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, PR template, or a short permission-email and commercialization agreement draft, tell me and I'll add them.
